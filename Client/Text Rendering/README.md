##### Text Rendering

<b>note:  these examples will work on actual Maestro flipdots driver AFTER the send UID is implemented.  I will be working on this next.</b> 

##### Files

<ul>
  <li><b>simple_text.py</b> The example FlipApp</li>
  <li><b>dotFont.py</b> The font loading & handling class</li>
  <li><b>dots_all_for_now.yaml</b> An example font file - only 3 characters included A,B & C</li>
 </ul>


<p>
 You can create your own font files by making a copy of dots_all_for_now.yaml and editing the contents.  You can also add more characters to the existing font file by adding more bitmap arrays within the bitmaps: section of the font file.
